# Vehicle Import System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **FR1:** Streamline the 15-step vehicle import process into a systematic, technology-enabled workflow
- **FR2:** Provide real-time visibility and tracking across all process stages for internal staff
- **FR3:** Automate document management, verification, and workflow coordination
- **FR4:** Enable comprehensive customer relationship management with communication automation
- **FR5:** Implement integrated payment tracking and cash flow management
- **FR6:** Create operational dashboards for pipeline management and exception handling
- **FR7:** Establish automated communication systems for status updates and notifications
- **FR8:** Provide comprehensive reporting and analytics for business intelligence
- **FR9:** Integrate with external systems (banks, shipping, customs, insurance)

### Background Context

The vehicle import business operates through a complex 15-step process spanning 2-3 months, involving multiple stakeholders including customers, banks, exporters, shipping lines, customs officials, and clearing agents. Currently, this process relies on manual coordination and lacks systematic visibility, creating opportunities for inefficiencies and communication gaps.

This system will transform the existing manual workflow into a comprehensive, technology-enabled platform that provides real-time tracking, automated document management, integrated payment processing, and systematic communication across all stakeholders. The solution will be built using React TypeScript, Redux, NestJS, and Google Cloud Platform, focusing on internal staff as the primary user base while maintaining mobile-responsive design for field operations.
