### API Endpoints

- `GET /bank/integrations` - List bank integrations
- `POST /bank/integrations` - Create bank integration
- `GET /bank/lc-processing` - Get LC processing status
- `POST /bank/lc-processing` - Process LC
- `GET /bank/transactions` - Get bank transactions
- `GET /bank/balance` - Get account balance
- `POST /bank/payment` - Process payment
- `GET /bank/reporting` - Get bank integration reports

### Bank Integration Features

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Bank API integration for LC processing works
- [ ] Payment confirmation and status tracking function
- [ ] Bank account balance monitoring works
- [ ] Transaction history synchronization functions
- [ ] Payment automation and scheduling work
- [ ] Bank security and authentication function
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms work
- [ ] Bank integration reporting and monitoring function
- [ ] Integration with multiple bank systems works
- [ ] All tests pass

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
- Story 1.2: Authentication and User Management
- Story 4.1: Payment Tracking System

## Estimated Effort

- **Story Points:** 13
- **Estimated Hours:** 26-39 hours
- **Complexity:** Very High (external API integration and security)

## Notes

Bank integration requires careful security implementation and thorough testing. Ensure all financial transactions are properly secured and the system can handle various bank API formats and error conditions.
