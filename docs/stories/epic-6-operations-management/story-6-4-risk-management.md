# Story 6.4: Risk Management and Early Warning System

## User Story

As an **operations manager**,  
I want **early warning systems and trend analytics**,  
so that **I can proactively identify and address potential issues**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **1:** Risk identification system flags potential issues
2. **2:** Trend analytics identify patterns and anomalies
3. **3:** Early warning alerts for delays and exceptions
4. **4:** Risk assessment scoring for vehicles and processes
5. **5:** Risk mitigation recommendations and actions
6. **6:** Risk reporting and dashboard visualization
7. **7:** Integration with external risk assessment tools
8. **8:** Risk history and learning system
9. **9:** Automated risk response workflows

## Technical Instructions

### Backend Implementation

- Create risk management model with DynamoDB schema
- Implement risk identification algorithms
- Add trend analytics and anomaly detection
- Create early warning alert system
- Implement risk assessment scoring
- Add risk mitigation recommendations

### Frontend Implementation

- Create risk management dashboard with Tailwind CSS
- Implement risk identification interface
- Create trend analytics visualization
- Add early warning alert interface
- Implement risk assessment interface
- Create risk mitigation action interface

### DynamoDB Schema

```typescript
// Risk Assessments table
{
  PK: "RISK#${riskId}",
  SK: "DETAILS",
  riskId: string,
  vehicleId: string,
  orderId: string,
  riskType: "Delay" | "Quality" | "Financial" | "Compliance" | "Supplier",
  severity: "Low" | "Medium" | "High" | "Critical",
  probability: number, // 0-1
  impact: number, // 0-1
  riskScore: number, // probability * impact
  description: string,
  indicators: string[],
  mitigationActions: string[],
  status: "Identified" | "Mitigating" | "Resolved" | "Escalated",
  identifiedBy: string,
  identifiedAt: string,
  resolvedAt: string,
  resolvedBy: string
}

// Risk Analytics table
{
  PK: "ANALYTICS#RISK",
  SK: "DATE#${date}",
  date: string,
  riskMetrics: {
    totalRisks: number,
    highSeverityRisks: number,
    resolvedRisks: number,
    averageRiskScore: number,
    riskTrends: {
      [riskType]: number
    }
  },
  anomalyDetections: string[],
  earlyWarnings: string[],
  createdAt: string
}
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /risks` - List risks with filters
- `GET /risks/:id` - Get risk details
- `POST /risks` - Create new risk assessment
- `PUT /risks/:id` - Update risk assessment
- `POST /risks/:id/mitigate` - Apply mitigation actions
- `GET /risks/analytics` - Get risk analytics
- `GET /risks/early-warnings` - Get early warning alerts
- `GET /risks/trends` - Get risk trend analysis

### Risk Types

- **Delay Risk:** Process delays and bottlenecks
- **Quality Risk:** Vehicle quality and condition issues
- **Financial Risk:** Payment and cost overruns
- **Compliance Risk:** Regulatory and legal issues
- **Supplier Risk:** Supplier performance and reliability issues

### Risk Scoring Matrix

- **Probability:** 0.1 (Very Low) to 1.0 (Very High)
- **Impact:** 0.1 (Minimal) to 1.0 (Severe)
- **Risk Score:** Probability Ã— Impact
- **Severity Levels:**
  - Low: 0.0 - 0.3
  - Medium: 0.3 - 0.6
  - High: 0.6 - 0.8
  - Critical: 0.8 - 1.0

### Early Warning Indicators

- **Process Delays:** Steps taking longer than average
- **Quality Issues:** Vehicle condition problems
- **Payment Delays:** Overdue payments
- **Supplier Issues:** Performance degradation
- **Compliance Violations:** Regulatory issues

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Risk identification system flags issues correctly
- [ ] Trend analytics identify patterns accurately
- [ ] Early warning alerts are sent timely
- [ ] Risk assessment scoring is accurate
- [ ] Risk mitigation recommendations are actionable
- [ ] Risk reporting and visualization work
- [ ] Integration with external tools functions
- [ ] Risk history and learning system works
- [ ] Automated risk response workflows function
- [ ] All tests pass

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
- Story 1.2: Authentication and User Management
- Story 3.2: 15-Step Process Tracking

## Estimated Effort

- **Story Points:** 13
- **Estimated Hours:** 26-39 hours
- **Complexity:** Very High (AI/ML and analytics)

## Notes

Risk management requires sophisticated analytics and machine learning capabilities. Ensure the risk identification algorithms are properly tuned and validated before production deployment.
