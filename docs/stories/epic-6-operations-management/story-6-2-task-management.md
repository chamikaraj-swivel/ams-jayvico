### DynamoDB Schema

```typescript
// Tasks table
{
  PK: "TASK#${taskId}",
  SK: "DETAILS",
  taskId: string,
  vehicleId: string,
  orderId: string,
  processStep: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  type: "Document Review" | "Payment Processing" | "Customs Clearance" | "Shipping Arrangement" | "Customer Communication",
  priority: "Low" | "Medium" | "High" | "Critical",
  status: "Pending" | "In Progress" | "Completed" | "Cancelled" | "Overdue",
  assignedTo: string,
  assignedBy: string,
  dueDate: string,
  completedDate: string,
  estimatedDuration: number, // in hours
  actualDuration: number,
  dependencies: string[], // Task IDs
  notes: string,
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt: string
}

// Task Templates table
{
  PK: "TEMPLATE#${templateId}",
  SK: "DETAILS",
  templateId: string,
  processStep: string,
  taskType: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  priority: string,
  estimatedDuration: number,
  requiredRole: string,
  isActive: boolean,
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt: string
}
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /tasks` - List tasks with filters
- `GET /tasks/:id` - Get task details
- `POST /tasks` - Create new task
- `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update task
- `POST /tasks/:id/assign` - Assign task
- `POST /tasks/:id/complete` - Complete task
- `GET /tasks/overdue` - Get overdue tasks
- `GET /tasks/analytics` - Get task analytics
- `GET /tasks/templates` - List task templates

### Task Assignment Logic

- **Role-Based Assignment:** Assign tasks based on user roles
- **Workload Balancing:** Distribute tasks evenly among staff
- **Skill Matching:** Assign tasks based on user skills
- **Availability Consideration:** Consider user availability and workload

### Task Priority Levels

- **Critical:** Must be completed within 2 hours
- **High:** Must be completed within 8 hours
- **Medium:** Must be completed within 24 hours
- **Low:** Must be completed within 72 hours

### Escalation Rules

- **Critical Tasks:** Escalate after 1 hour overdue
- **High Priority:** Escalate after 4 hours overdue
- **Medium Priority:** Escalate after 12 hours overdue
- **Low Priority:** Escalate after 24 hours overdue
