# Story 1.2: Authentication and User Management

## User Story

As a **system administrator**,  
I want **secure authentication and role-based user management**,  
so that **internal staff can securely access the system with appropriate permissions**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **1:** JWT-based authentication is implemented for secure user sessions
2. **2:** User registration and login functionality is working
3. **3:** Role-based access control is implemented with predefined roles (Admin, Operations Manager, Customer Service, Finance, Field Staff)
4. **4:** Password security requirements are enforced (minimum length, complexity)
5. **5:** Session management includes automatic logout and token refresh
6. **6:** User profile management allows users to update their information
7. **7:** Admin can create, update, and deactivate user accounts
8. **8:** Audit logging tracks all authentication events
9. **9:** Mobile-responsive authentication works on all device types

## Technical Instructions

### Backend Implementation

- Implement JWT authentication using Passport.js
- Create user model with DynamoDB schema
- Implement password hashing with bcrypt
- Create role-based middleware for route protection
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Set up audit logging for authentication events

### Frontend Implementation

- Create login/register forms with Tailwind CSS
- Implement Redux store for authentication state
- Create protected route components
- Implement automatic token refresh
- Create user profile management interface
- Implement role-based UI rendering

### DynamoDB Schema

```typescript
// Users table
{
  PK: "USER#${userId}",
  SK: "PROFILE",
  userId: string,
  email: string,
  passwordHash: string,
  role: "Admin" | "OperationsManager" | "CustomerService" | "Finance" | "FieldStaff",
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  isActive: boolean,
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt: string,
  lastLoginAt: string
}
```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /auth/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /auth/profile` - Update user profile
- `GET /admin/users` - List all users (Admin only)
- `POST /admin/users` - Create user (Admin only)
- `PUT /admin/users/:id` - Update user (Admin only)

### Security Requirements

- Password minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Refresh tokens expire after 7 days
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- HTTPS enforcement in production

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Login/logout functionality works correctly
- [ ] Role-based access control is enforced
- [ ] Password security requirements are implemented
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism works
- [ ] User profile management is functional
- [ ] Admin user management is working
- [ ] Audit logging captures all auth events
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design is implemented
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration)

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Estimated Effort

- **Story Points:** 5
- **Estimated Hours:** 10-15 hours
- **Complexity:** Medium

## Notes

Ensure all authentication flows are thoroughly tested, including edge cases like expired tokens and invalid credentials. Security is critical for this system.
