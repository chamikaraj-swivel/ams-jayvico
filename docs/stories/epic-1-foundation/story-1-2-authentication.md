# Story 1.2: Authentication and User Management

**Status:** Ready for Review

## User Story

As a **system administrator**,
I want **Firebase-based authentication and user management**,
so that **internal staff can securely access the system and only authorized users can create new accounts**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **1:** All authentication must use **Firebase Authentication (Email & Password)** directly — no custom backend authentication logic.
2. **2:** Users can **log in using email and password** via Firebase Authentication.
3. **3:** **Self sign-up is not allowed** on the login screen — no public registration form is available.
4. **4:** Only **existing logged-in users (with permission)** can **create new user accounts** using Firebase Authentication.
5. **5:** When a new user account is created, **temporary credentials** are generated and shared with that user.
6. **6:** On the **first login**, the new user must be **prompted to change their password** before gaining full access to the system.
7. **7:** Role-based access control is supported (Admin, Operations Manager, Customer Service, Finance, Field Staff).
8. **8:** Users can update their own profile information.
9. **9:** The system UI must be mobile responsive.

## Technical Instructions

### Authentication Implementation

- Use **Firebase Authentication (Email/Password)** directly in the frontend.
- No backend service should be involved in authentication (no JWT, no Passport, no token refresh endpoints).
- Use Firebase Admin SDK (client-side privileged user session) or Firebase REST API from authenticated admin users to create new users.
- Implement a **“force password change on first login”** mechanism:

  - Store a `mustChangePassword` flag in Firestore/Realtime Database linked to the user.
  - On first login, if `mustChangePassword` is `true`, redirect to a password reset screen before allowing access.

- Use Firebase’s `updatePassword()` method for password changes.

### Frontend Implementation

- Build a **login screen** with email/password fields (using Firebase Auth).
- Build a **user management interface** (only visible to logged-in users with appropriate roles) to:

  - Create new users (set initial temporary password and role)
  - Manage user profiles and deactivate users

- Implement **protected routes** that block unauthenticated access.
- Implement **role-based UI rendering** (only Admin sees user management tools, etc.).
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.

### Data Model (Firestore/Realtime Database)

```typescript
// users collection
{
  userId: string,            // Firebase UID
  email: string,
  role: "Admin" | "OperationsManager" | "CustomerService" | "Finance" | "FieldStaff",
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  mustChangePassword: boolean,
  isActive: boolean,
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt: string,
  lastLoginAt: string
}
```

### Security Requirements

- Enforce password complexity on creation.
- Ensure only logged-in users with Admin or privileged roles can create new users.
- Protect all routes using Firebase Authentication state.
- Use HTTPS in production.

## Definition of Done

- [x] Firebase Authentication is integrated and functional
- [x] Users can log in using email/password
- [x] No public sign-up option is visible
- [x] Logged-in users can create new user accounts
- [x] New users are forced to change their password on first login
- [x] Role-based access is enforced
- [x] Profile update works
- [x] Mobile responsive design works
- [x] All tests pass (unit + integration)

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Estimated Effort

- **Story Points:** 5
- **Estimated Hours:** 10–15 hours
- **Complexity:** Medium

## Notes

- **Do not use any backend services for authentication.**
- All authentication must happen via Firebase directly on the client.
- Only logged-in users with appropriate permissions can create new accounts.
- Newly created users must change their password before accessing the system.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4 (via Cursor)

### Debug Log References

- Fixed "Failed to fetch user profile" error by implementing proper error handling for missing Firestore profiles
- Added userProfileExists() method to check Firestore profile existence
- Enhanced getUserProfile() to provide clear error messages for missing profiles
- Updated signIn() and auth state listener to handle missing profiles with proper user feedback
- **SECURITY IMPROVEMENT:** Removed automatic profile creation to maintain admin-only user creation policy
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Identified and resolved Firestore security rules issue causing "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors
- Created comprehensive Firestore security rules allowing users to read their own profiles and admins to manage all users

### Completion Notes

- ✅ Firebase Authentication fully integrated with email/password login
- ✅ Login form implemented with proper error handling and loading states
- ✅ No public sign-up - only admin users can create new accounts
- ✅ User management interface implemented with role-based access control
- ✅ Password change modal blocks access until new password is set
- ✅ Role-based UI rendering in sidebar and route protection
- ✅ Profile update functionality implemented
- ✅ Mobile responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- ✅ All authentication flows properly implemented
