8. **8:** Audit trail reporting provides insights into system usage and changes
9. **9:** Audit trail integration with external compliance systems

## Technical Instructions

### Backend Implementation

- Create audit trail model with DynamoDB schema
- Implement change tracking middleware
- Create audit trail search and filtering
- Add export functionality for compliance
- Implement audit trail retention policy
- Create rollback capability for critical changes

### Frontend Implementation

- Create audit trail interface with Tailwind CSS
- Implement search and filter interface
- Create audit trail export interface
- Add rollback confirmation interface
- Implement audit trail reporting dashboard
- Create compliance reporting interface

### DynamoDB Schema

```typescript
// Audit Trail table
{
  PK: "AUDIT#${entityType}#${entityId}",
  SK: "CHANGE#${timestamp}",
  auditId: string,
  entityType: "Vehicle" | "Order" | "Customer" | "Payment",
  entityId: string,
  action: "Create" | "Update" | "Delete" | "Status Change" | "System Generated",
  fieldName: string,
  oldValue: any,
  newValue: any,
  userId: string,
  userName: string,
  userRole: string,
  timestamp: string,
  ipAddress: string,
  userAgent: string,
  changeReason: string,
  isSystemGenerated: boolean,
  canRollback: boolean
}

// Audit Trail Indexes
{
  PK: "AUDIT#USER#${userId}",
  SK: "CHANGE#${timestamp}",
  // Same fields as above
}

{
  PK: "AUDIT#DATE#${date}",
  SK: "CHANGE#${timestamp}",
  // Same fields as above
}
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /audit-trail` - List audit trail with search/filter
- `GET /audit-trail/:id` - Get audit trail details
- `GET /audit-trail/search` - Search audit trail by criteria
- `GET /audit-trail/export` - Export audit trail data
- `POST /audit-trail/:id/rollback` - Rollback specific change
- `GET /audit-trail/reporting` - Get audit trail analytics

### Audit Trail Features

- **Change Tracking:** All CRUD operations
- **User Attribution:** Who made the change
- **Timestamp:** When the change occurred
- **Field-Level Changes:** What specific fields changed
- **Reason Tracking:** Why the change was made
- **Rollback Capability:** Ability to undo critical changes

### Retention Policy

- **Active Data:** 2 years
- **Archived Data:** 7 years
- **Compliance Data:** 10 years
- **System Logs:** 1 year

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete audit trail tracks all changes
- [ ] Audit log includes all required information
- [ ] Search and filtering work correctly
- [ ] Export functionality generates correct reports
- [ ] Retention policy is properly implemented
- [ ] System and user changes are tracked

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure
- Story 1.2: Authentication and User Management
- Story 1.3: Basic Vehicle Record Management

## Estimated Effort

- **Story Points:** 8
- **Estimated Hours:** 16-24 hours
- **Complexity:** High (compliance and data integrity)

## Notes

Audit trail is critical for compliance and data integrity. Ensure all changes are properly tracked and the system can handle high-volume audit data efficiently.
